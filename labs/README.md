## 340lx Labs.

Now that you have a solid grasp of low-level hardware and code, we build
more advanced stuff, and go much deeper.

The labs will generally involve:
 - Fun devices (usually fancier ones than in 240lx).
 - New sbc's.
 - Speed.

Differences from from 140e/240lx: 
  1. Around half of the labs are usually student-written.
     You have already suffered through over 30 labs as consumers, so
     now is your chance to buld the labs you would have wanted.
  2. Micro-projects: 1 to 2 week independent work on a project of your
     own design that uses the preceeding labs.

     - Motivation for micro-projects: 
       - By now you've done 30-40 low level 140e/240lx labs.
         We try to synthesize these pieces by using several smaller open
         ended projects.
       - Thinking a lot on your own about something of your own design tends
         to be more fun. Especially since you don't have to understand 
         staff starter code, or get through long README's.
       - There's always lots of ideas we get to steal from for 140e/240lx.

The labs:
   - [0-setup](0-setup): check that your class repo works.
   - [1-fast-dev-int](1-fast-dev-int/): take a simple program that
     generates device interrupts and make them as fast as possible.
   - [2-pcb](2-pbc): currently we can only use devices people have put on
     a breakout board and we have to pay what they charge.  In this lab,
     Parthiv (of 140e breakout board fame) shows you how to design a
     small PCB using kicad so you can make your own boards.
   - [3-hdmi](3-hdmi): we give you an HDMI display, you use the pi
     mailbox interface to get it up and running.
   - [4-lidar](4-lidar): we give you an okgo lidar, you use the pi
     to get it up and running.

Micro-project 1:
   - Combine the display and lidar (and any other devices you want)
     into a cool project.  You have a week and we'll demo in class.
